## CDNBye :id=head
> A free hls.js plugin to offload bandwidth from expensive traditional CDNs，while also maximizing a user’s viewing experience. 

## Next Generation Web P2P Technology
This JS library implements WebRTC datachannel to scale live/vod video streaming by peer-to-peer network using bittorrent-like protocol. The forming peer network can be layed over other CDNs or on top of the origin server. Powered by hls.js, it can play HLS on any platform with many popular HTML5 players such as video.js, JWPlayer and Flowplayer.

## Features
- 采用仿BT算法，简化BT的流程，并且针对流媒体的特点对算法进行调整
- 不改动hls.js源码，并且可以与其无缝衔接，几行代码集成，便于在现有项目中快速集成
- 高可配置化，用户可以根据特定的使用环境调整各个参数
- 支持video.js、Clappr、Flowplayer等第三方播放器
- 通过有效的调度策略来保证用户的播放体验以及p2p率
- Tracker服务器根据访问IP的ISP、地域等进行智能调度
