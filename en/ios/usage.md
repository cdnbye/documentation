## Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries in your projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

#### Podfile

To integrate CDNByeSDK into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'TargetName' do
pod 'CDNByeSDK'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

## Integration
In order to allow the loading of distributed content via the local proxy, enable loading data from HTTP in your app by opening your info.plist file as source code and adding the following values below the </dict> tag:
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

#### Include
```
#import <CDNByeKit/CBP2pEngine.h>
```

#### Usage
When initializing an AVPlayer (or any other video player) instance, before passing it a URL, pass that URL through CDNBye P2P Engine:
```
CBP2pEngine *engine = [[CBP2pEngine alloc] initWithToken:@"free" andP2pConfig:nil];
NSURL *url = [engine parseStreamURL:@"https://your_stream.m3u8"];   
_player = [[AVPlayer alloc] initWithURL:url];
```
Thatâ€™s it! CDNBye should now be integrated into your app.
