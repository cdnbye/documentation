## Introduction
The configuration of m3u8 and hls.js will have a great impact on the P2P streaming. The proper configuration can significantly increase the P2P ratio. It is not recommended to use multi-bitrate m3u8.

## Recommended m3u8 Config for live
- ts duration: <= 5 seconds
- number of ts in playlist: >= 6

## Recommended hls.js Config
```javascript
hlsjsConfig: {
    maxBufferSize: 0,       
    maxBufferLength: 5,     
    liveSyncDuration: 30,   // used in live
    // See https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/blob/master/docs/API.md
}
```
