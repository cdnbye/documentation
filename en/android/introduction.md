### Live/VOD P2P Engine for Android and Android TV
CDNBye Android P2P Engine scales live/vod video streaming by peer-to-peer network using bittorrent-like protocol. Powered by WebRTC Datachannel, this SDK can interconnect with the Web side [plug-in](https://github.com/cdnbye/hlsjs-p2p-engine) of CDNBye, which greatly increases the number of nodes in the P2P network, breaking the gap between the browser and mobile application. Merely a few lines of codes are required to quickly integrate into existing projects. As expected, it supports Android mobile and Android TV!
